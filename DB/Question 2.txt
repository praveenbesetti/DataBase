How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it? 

 Ans :

      To ensure that each product in the "product" table has a valid category assignment, you can set up a foreign key constraint between the "Category id" column in the "product" table and the "Id" column in the "product category" table. This constraint will enforce referential integrity, ensuring that any value in the "Category id" column of the "product" table must match an existing value in the "Id" column of the "product category" table.
